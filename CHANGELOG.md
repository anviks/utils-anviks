# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).


## [2.1.2] - 2025-06-22

### Fixed
- Release is now built for all primary operating systems


## [2.1.1] - 2025-06-22

### Fixed
- Corrected the logic for determining whether a cell is a neighbour of another cell.
- Grid.__setitem__ no longer throws an error, when empty list is passed.


## [2.1.0] - 2025-01-06

### Added
- Introduced the `Grid` class for managing two-dimensional grid data,
  easy traversal, transformation, and more.
- Introduced the `Cell` class for representing individual locations within a grid,
  providing a convenient way to handle row and column based data.

### Changed
- Removed underscore prefixes from module names.


## [2.0.1] - 2024-12-01

### Changed
- Added overloaded signatures to `parse_file_content` and `parse_string` to provide accurate
  return types based on the length of `separators` tuple passed as an argument.


## [2.0.0] - 2024-06-19

### Added
- `dict_to_object` function to convert a dictionary to an object.
- `CaptureMalloc` context manager class to capture memory allocations within a block of code.
- `parse_string` function to parse a string using the provided arguments.
  It's identical to the `parse_file_content` function but works with strings instead of files.

### Changed
- `parse_file_content` function now accepts a tuple of separators as an argument,
  instead of having a separate argument for each separator. Additionally, the function now
  has no limit on the number of separators that can be provided. However, type hints for the
  function support only up to 5 separators, since recursive type hints are not widely supported,
  and it's unlikely that more than 5 separators will be needed.

### Removed
- `read_file` decorator has been removed in favor of the more versatile `parse_file_content` function.
- `memoize` decorator has been removed due to redundancy - `functools.lru_cache` can be used instead,
  with no loss of functionality or performance.


## [1.1.0] - 2024-04-22

### Added
- Introduced the `parse_file_content` function as an alternative to the `read_file` decorator.
  The `parse_file_content` function provides equivalent functionality to the `read_file` decorator, but in a
  more versatile and widely applicable form.

### Deprecated
- Deprecated the `read_file` decorator in favor of the `parse_file_content` function.
  The `read_file` decorator is no longer recommended for use and will be removed in a future release.
  Users are encouraged to migrate to the `parse_file_content` function for file parsing functionality.


## [1.0.2] - 2024-03-27

### Fixed
- Fixed the issue, where the `stopwatch` decorator, when used on recursive functions,
  would start a new timer for each recursive call. Now, the decorator will only
  start a timer for the first call and return the total time taken by the function
  and all its recursive calls.


## [1.0.1] - 2024-03-04

### Changed
- Updated project links in `pyproject.toml`.


## [1.0.0] - 2024-03-03

### Added
- Official release of the package.
